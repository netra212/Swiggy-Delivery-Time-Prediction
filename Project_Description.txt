# Business Use case. 
- In the competitive food delivery market, on-time delivery is critical for customer satisfaction, retention, and operation efficiency. A company wants to optimize delivery time predictions to improve customer experience by providing accurate estimated delivery times (ETAs) and to manage resources effectively. Accurate predictions of delivery time can also allow the business to:
    1. Improve Delivery efficiency:
        - Identifying factors that slow down deliveries enables better resource allocation, such as more reliable scheduling for deliver personnel. 
    2. Enhance Customer Satisfaction:
        - REeliable delivery ETAs can improve the customer experience by reducing wait-time uncertainty.
    3. Optimize Operational Costs:
        - If the model can predict scenarios with higher delays, additional resources (like more drivers or prioritizing specific orders) can be allocated. 

# How ML Helps ?
1 Enhanced Customer Experience.
    - Customer Satisfaction and Retention.
    - Improved Transparan

In Summary:-

    3. Accurate time predictions reduces chances of cancelled orders. 
    4. Increased transparency can help in lower customer service calls which eases up traffic of complaints those are time related.
    5. The dispath team for riderss can plan routes and manpower accordingly to serve customers on time. 
    6. They can focus on hotspots in the city which have increased orders at certain time of delay, month, year. 
    7. Can help company implement surge pricing in extreme weather or congestion events. 

# Riders:
1. Riders can plan pickups and deliveries accordingly. 
2. They have a foresight of time taken for delievery so can manage multiple orders along the same route. 
3. Can help in route planning in case of traffic congestion. 
4. Can do faster deliveries and limit wait times to increase number of deliveries per day which increases their earning potential. 
5. Drivers do not have to rush or do risky drivining during high rush hours as their deliver time are in synchrony with the on ground situation which give them peace of mind and reduces the chances of unncessary cancellations and do not impact their ratings.

3. They can scale up staff and resources during events of increased demands. 
4. Company can also leverage discounts and coupons to increase demand during off peak hours which results in continous revenue generation.

# What Metrics to use ?
- RMSE and MAE because we are predicting the time here. so we have to keep our unit same. because our riders and customers will not understand mins_square or mins^square. 

- RMSE = np.sqrt(np.sum(y_i - y_hat)^2 / n)
- MAE = np.sum(y_i - y_hat)
