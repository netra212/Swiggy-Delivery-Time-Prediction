# Business Use case. 
- In the competitive food delivery market, on-time delivery is critical for customer satisfaction, retention, and operation efficiency. A company wants to optimize delivery time predictions to improve customer experience by providing accurate estimated delivery times (ETAs) and to manage resources effectively. Accurate predictions of delivery time can also allow the business to:
    1. Improve Delivery efficiency:
        - Identifying factors that slow down deliveries enables better resource allocation, such as more reliable scheduling for deliver personnel. 
    2. Enhance Customer Satisfaction:
        - REeliable delivery ETAs can improve the customer experience by reducing wait-time uncertainty.
    3. Optimize Operational Costs:
        - If the model can predict scenarios with higher delays, additional resources (like more drivers or prioritizing specific orders) can be allocated. 

# How ML Helps ?
1 Enhanced Customer Experience.
    - Customer Satisfaction and Retention.
    - Improved Transparan

In Summary:-
Overall:-
    1. Increase customer satisfaction as customers can plan their order meals. 
    2. Increase customer trust in company. Clear accurate ETAs improve transparency, a factor increasingly valued by customers. If a delay is predicted due to conditions like traffic or weather, proactive updates to ETAs reassure customers that they are informed. 
    3. Accurate time predictions reduces chances of cancelled orders. 
    4. Increased transparency can help in lower customer service calls which eases up traffic of complaints those are time related.
    5. The dispath team for riderss can plan routes and manpower accordingly to serve customers on time. 
    6. They can focus on hotspots in the city which have increased orders at certain time of delay, month, year. 
    7. Can help company implement surge pricing in extreme weather or congestion events. 

# Riders:
1. Riders can plan pickups and deliveries accordingly. 
2. They have a foresight of time taken for delievery so can manage multiple orders along the same route. 
3. Can help in route planning in case of traffic congestion. 
4. Can do faster deliveries and limit wait times to increase number of deliveries per day which increases their earning potential. 
5. Drivers do not have to rush or do risky drivining during high rush hours as their deliver time are in synchrony with the on ground situation which give them peace of mind and reduces the chances of unncessary cancellations and do not impact their ratings. 
6. Can opt for other providers when demand is less to increase their earnings. 
7. Can tackle multiples deliveries. 


# Restaurants. 
1. They can priotize their orders if delivery times are available. 
2. They can manage staff to balance out between in house orders vs home deliveries. 
3. They can scale up staff and resources during events of increased demands. 
4. Company can also leverage discounts and coupons to increase demand during off peak hours which results in continous revenue generation.

# What Metrics to use ?
- RMSE and MAE because we are predicting the time here. so we have to keep our unit same. because our riders and customers will not understand mins_square or mins^square. 

- RMSE = np.sqrt(np.sum(y_i - y_hat)^2 / n) - Robust to outliers because it penalized.  
- MAE = np.sum(y_i - y_hat) - Gives the true pictures because we want to handle the outliers Points as well. 

# How It can Impacts in Business ?
1. Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):

    - Impact: With accurate ETAs, customers feel more informed and are less likely to experience frustration from delays or inaccurate delivery windows.

    - Measurement: Customer satisfaction surveys or ratings post-delivery. A rise in CSAT often indicates positive customer experiences.

2. Customer Retention Rate:

    - Impact: Satisfied customers are more likely to reorder, especially if the delivery experience meets or exceeds expectations consistently.

    - Measurement: Percentage of customers who continue ordering after their initial experiences. Improved ETAs help build customer trust and encourage repeat business.

3. Average Order Value (AOV)

    - Impact: When customers trust the delivery process, they may place larger or more frequent orders, especially during promotions or peak times.

    - Measurement: Monitoring trends in order value over time can indicate that enhanced delivery service is encouraging higher spending.

4. Delivery Success Rate

    - Impact: Reduced late deliveries and minimized cancellation rates can increase the proportion of successful deliveries.

    - Measurement: Percentage of orders successfully delivered within the promised time frame. Lowering cancellation rates or delays directly impacts delivery success.

5. Operational Efficiency Metrics:

    - Driver Utilization Rate: Predictive ETAs allow for better routing and delivery clustering, optimizing each driverâ€™s workload.

    - Delivery per Hour: Accurate predictions reduce idle time and allow drivers to complete more orders per shift.

    - Cost per Delivery: Fewer delays and optimized routing reduce fuel costs, time on the road, and labour costs per delivery.

6. Customer Support Cost

    - Impact: Fewer customers will call support for delivery updates if they have a reliable ETA. This reduces operational costs tied to customer service.

    - Measurement: Reduced volume of time-related inquiries and complaints means lower customer support costs, indicating a positive impact from reliable delivery predictions.

7. Order Cancellation Rate

    - Impact: With accurate ETAs, customers are less likely to cancel orders due to long or uncertain wait times.
    - Measurement: The percentage of orders cancelled by customers can drop with improved delivery time accuracy.
